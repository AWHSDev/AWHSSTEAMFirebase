#[about] About
**The Arvada West STEAM Club** provides an opportunity to enhance personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). Members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs. There will be opportunities for school-based competitions monthly and off-site competitions including Colorado Technology Student Association (TSA) Conference and US Department of Energy's High School Regional Science Bowl. STEAM members can participate in any or all of these competitions. (You do not have to do them all to be a member of STEAM!)
